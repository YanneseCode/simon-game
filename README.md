### Welcome to Building the Simon Game! What is the Simon Game? 
The Simon Game is a fun memory game that gives players a sequence of colors. The playerâ€™s job is to repeat the sequence in the right order, and each time they get it right, the game adds one more color to the sequence. The challenge is to remember the growing sequence!
